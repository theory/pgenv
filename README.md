Description
-----------

pgenv is a simple utility to build and run different releases of [PostgreSQL].
This makes it easy to switch between versions when testing applications for
compatibility.

Installation
------------

1.  Check out pgenv into `~/.pgenv`.

    ``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/theory/pgenv.git ~/.pgenv
    ```

2.  Add `~/.pgenv/bin` and `~/.pgenv/pgsql/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to
    the `pgenv` command-line utility and all the programs provided by
    PostgreSQL:
   
    ``` sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pgenv/bin:$HOME/.pgenv/pgsql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.profile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3.  Restart your shell as a login shell so the path changes take effect. You
    can now begin using pgenv.

    ~~~ sh
    $ exec $SHELL -l
    ~~~

4.  Build a version of PostgreSQL:

    ~~~ sh
    $ pgenv build 10.4
    ~~~

### Configuration

By default, all versions of PostgreSQL will be built in the root of the
project directory (generally, in `~/.pgenv`.). If you'd like them to live
elsewhere, set the `$PGENV_ROOT` environment variable to the appropriate
value.

Each instance will be compiled with support for PL/Perl and/or PL/Python
depending on the existance of interpreters. It is possible to compile
an instance with a particular interpreter or without PL/Perl or PL/Python
setting variables before the build process is started. See the section
about `build`.

### Upgrading

You can upgrade your installation to the cutting-edge version at any time
with a simple `git pull`.

~~~ sh
$ cd ~/.pgenv
$ git pull
~~~

### Dependencies
------------

*   bash
*   curl - Used to download files
*   sed, grep, cat, tar - General Unix command line utilities
*   patch - For patching versions that need patching
*   make -  Builds PostgreSQL
*   Perl 5 - To build PL/Perl (not mandatory)
*   Python - To build PL/Python (not mandatory)

Command Reference
-----------------

Like `git`, the `pgenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The subcommands are:

### pgenv use

Sets the version of PostgreSQL to be used in all shells by symlinking its
directory to `~/.pgenv/pgsql` and starting it. Initializes the data directory if
none exists. If another version is currently active, it will be stopped before
switching. If the specified version is already in use, the `use` command won't
stop it, but will initialize its data directory and start it if it is not
already running.

    $ pgenv use 10.4
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    waiting for server to start.... done
    server started
    PostgreSQL 10.4 started

### pgenv versions

Lists all PostgreSQL versions known to `pgenv`, and shows an asterisk next to the
currently active version (if any). The first column reports the version number to use
in other `pgenv` commands, followed by the directory where the version is installed:

    $ pgenv versions
            10.5            pgsql-10.5
            10.3            pgsql-10.3
     *      9.6.10          pgsql-9.6.10

In the above output, version `9.6.10` is currently in use (note the '*'),
and available versions are `9.6.10`, `10.3` and `10.5` which are installed
in a `pgsql-` local directory named after the version number.

### pgenv version

Displays the currently active PostgreSQL version.

    $ pgenv version
    pgsql-10.4

### pgenv clear

Clears the currently active version of PostgreSQL. If the current version is running,
`clear` will stop it before clearing it.

    $ pgenv clear
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    PostgreSQL stopped
    PostgreSQL cleared

### pgenv build

Downloads and builds the specified version of PostgreSQL and its contrib
modules, as far back as 8.0. PostgreSQL versions 8.0 and 8.1 will be patched
before building. If the version is already built, it will not be rebuilt; use
`clear` to remove an existing version before building it again.

    $ pgenv build 10.3
    # Curl, configure, and make output elided
    PostgreSQL 10.3 built

The build will install PL/Perl and/or PL/Python depending on the current environment:
if Perl and/or Python interpreters are available, the `configure` part of the build
process will reflect their presence and will build interpreters into the
PostgreSQL instance.
It is possible tro drive the PL/Perl and PL/Python `configure` process settings
the special variables `PGENV_PERL` and `PGENV_PYTHON` to the location of the
desired interpreter. In particular, the behavior for both variables is as follows:
- if the variable is not set or set to an empty string, the system will try to
  figure out if an interpreter exists within the user's `PATH` and will use such
  interpreter to build the PL-language;
- if the variable is set to an executable interpreter, the language will be built
  using such interpreter
- if the variable is set to a non-executable value, the language will not be built.

As an example, the following will build an instance without PL/Perl and
with a specific version of Python:

    $ PGENV_PERL=no PGENV_PYTHON=/usr/python/2.7/bin/python pgenv build 10.5


### pgenv remove

Removes the specified version of PostgreSQL unless it is the currently-active
version. Use the `clear` command to clear the active version before removing it.

    $ pgenv remove 10.3
    PostgreSQL 10.3 removed

### pgenv start

Starts the currently active version of PostgreSQL if it's not already running.
Initializes the data directory if none exists.

    $ pgenv start
    PostgreSQL started

### pgenv stop

Stops the currently active version of PostgreSQL.

    $ pgenv stop
    PostgreSQL stopped

### pgenv restart

Restarts the currently active version of PostgreSQL, or starts it if it's not
already running.

    $ pgenv restart
    PostgreSQL restarted

### pgenv available

Shows all the versions of PostgreSQL available to download and build. Handy to
find a version you want to pass to the `build` command. Note that this command
produces copious output.

    $ pgenv available
    ...
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

                        PostgreSQL 11
        ------------------------------------------------
        11beta1  11beta2  11beta3

The versions are organized and sorted by major release number. 
Any listed version may be passed to `pgenv` commands that require a version.

To limit the list to specific major releases, pass those releases to
`available` (in no particular order). 
For example, to list only the `9.6` and `10` available versions:

    $ pgenv available 9.6 10
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

### pgenv check

Checks the list of commands required to download and build PostgreSQL. Prints a
result for each, with either the path to the command or an error reporting that
the command was not found.

### pgenv help

Outputs a brief usage statement and summary of available commands, like
the following:

    Usage: pgenv <command> [<args>]

    The pgenv commands are:
        use        Set and start the current PostgreSQL version
        clear      Stop and unset the current PostgreSQL version
        start      Start the current PostgreSQL server
        stop       Stop the current PostgreSQL server
        restart    Restart the current PostgreSQL server
        build      Build a specific version of PostgreSQL

        version    Show the current PostgreSQL version
        versions   List all PostgreSQL versions available to pgenv
        help       Show this usage statement and command summary
