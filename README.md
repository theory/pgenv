Description
-----------

pgenv is a simple utility to build and run different releases of [PostgreSQL].
This makes it easy to switch between versions when testing applications for
compatibility.

Installation
------------

1.  Check out pgenv into `~/.pgenv`.

    ``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/theory/pgenv.git ~/.pgenv
    ```

2.  Add `~/.pgenv/bin` and `~/.pgenv/pgsql/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to
    the `pgenv` command-line utility and all the programs provided by
    PostgreSQL:
   
    ``` sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pgenv/bin:$HOME/.pgenv/pgsql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.profile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3.  Restart your shell as a login shell so the path changes take effect. You
    can now begin using pgenv.

    ~~~ sh
    $ exec $SHELL -l
    ~~~

4.  Build a version of PostgreSQL:

    ~~~ sh
    $ pgenv build 10.4
    ~~~

### Configuration

By default, all versions of PostgreSQL will be built in the root of the
project directory (generally in `~/.pgenv`.). If you'd like them to live
elsewhere, set the `$PGENV_ROOT` environment variable to the appropriate
directory.

It is possible to configure which programs, flags and languages to build
using a configuration file before the program launches the build. 
For a more detailed configuration, see the [`pgenv config`](#pgenv-config)
command below.

### Running scripts

It is possible to run custom script when particular events happen. 
The purpose is to let the user to configure the cluster as much as
she want, for instance installing extension or pre-loading data.

Custom scripts are driven by a set of configuration variables as follows:
- `PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTINSTALL` is an executable script run as soon as the `build`
finishes. The return value of the script does not affect the `pgenv` workflow.
The script gets the version of PostgreSQL being installed as first argument.

- `PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTINITDB` is an executable script run as soon as the `use`
command ends the `initdb` phase, that happens only the `PGDATA` has not been
initialized (i.e., on *very first `use`*). 
The return value of the script does not affect the `pgenv` workflow.
The script gets the current `PGDATA` path as first argument.

- `PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTSTART` is an executable script executed each time 
an instances is started, that is `start` is executed.
The return value of the script does not affect the `pgenv` workflow.
The script gets the current `PGDATA` path as first argument.


The above configuration variables can be set in the configuration file
or on the fly, for instance:

    $ export PGENV_SCRIPT_POSTSTART=/usr/local/bin/load_data.sh
    $ pgenv start 12.0
    
**Please note that running external scripts can result in damages and crashes in the `pgenv` workflow.**    
In the future, more hooks to run scripts could be added.

### Upgrading

You can upgrade your installation to the cutting-edge version at any time
with a simple `git pull`.

~~~ sh
$ cd ~/.pgenv
$ git pull
~~~

Command Reference
-----------------

Like `git`, the `pgenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The subcommands are:

### pgenv use

Sets the version of PostgreSQL to be used in all shells by symlinking its
directory to `~/$PGENV_ROOT/pgsql` and starting it. Initializes the data
directory if none exists. If another version is currently active, it will be
stopped before switching. If the specified version is already in use, the
`use` command won't stop it, but will initialize its data directory and starts
it if it's not already running.

    $ pgenv use 10.4
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    waiting for server to start.... done
    server started
    PostgreSQL 10.4 started

If an alias has been defined for a specific PostgreSQL version, it is possible
to specify the alias instead of the version number.


### pgenv versions

Lists all PostgreSQL versions known to `pgenv`, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version (if any). The first column reports versions
available for use by `pgenv` and the second lists the subdirectory of
`$PGENV_ROOT` in which the each version is installed (in square backets).
The third column lists aliases, if any are defined, for a particular
version of PostgreSQL.

    $ pgenv versions
          10.4      [pgsql-10.4/pgsql-10.4-2019-10-21-15-15-33]       { 10.4 stable java }
          11beta3   [pgsql-11beta3/pgsql-11beta3-2019-10-20-12-23-45] { 11beta3 beta }
          9.5.13    [pgsql-9.5.13/pgsql-9.5.13-2019-10-21-11-22-33]   { 9.5.13 foo bar }
      *   9.6.9     [pgsql-9.6.9/pgsql-9.6.9-2019-10-21-05-23-55]     { 9.6.9 }

In this example, versions `9.5.13`, `9.6.9`, `10.4`, and `11beta3` are
available for use, and the `*` indicates that `9.6.10` is the currently active
version. Version `10.4` has two aliases, namely `stable` and `java`, while
version `9.5.13` has aliases `foo` and `bar` and version `11beta3` has a single
alias named `beta`. Aliases are *user defined* names that can be used
to reference a PostgreSQL version, therefore naming `stable` or `10.4` is 
the same.
Each version is installed in a `pgsql-<version>/pgsql-<version>-<timestamp>` 
subdirectory relative to `$PGENV_ROOT`; the `<version>` is the PostgreSQL 
version (e.g., `9.6.9`) and `timestamp` is the timestamp of when the 
`build** command has been run.
**This allows for building multiple instances of the same PostgreSQL
version at different timestamps**.

Each time a version is built, a new default alias is built with the
PostgreSQL version, so that it is possible to use the version
as a name of PostgreSQL to use in other commands.

### pgenv alias

The `alias` command allows users to define their own mnemonic names to 
label a specific PostgreSQL version. Each command that requires a PostgreSQL
version (e.g., `use`, `remove`) can accept an alias, that in turn
is *translated** to the appropriate PostgreSQL version.

Aliases can be defined only for currently installed PostgreSQL versions, and
**must be unique**: it is not possible to define the same label for different
PostgreSQL versions.

Aliases are stored as symbolic links into the `alias` subdirectory of `PGENV_ROOT`.

The `alias` command requires subcommands:
- `add` adds one or more aliases to a PostgreSQL version. The PostgreSQL version
must be already installed, and each alias label must be unique. If an alias already
exists, the `add` command will skip such label and proceed to the next one (if any).
As an example:

     $ pgenv alias add 10.7 ten-stable my-favourite-version

defines two different alias, `ten-stale` and `my-favourite-version` that are
both aliases to version `10.7`. This means that it is possible to issue
a command that accepts a PostgreSQL version specifying the alias:
    
    $ pgenv use 10.7
    $ pgenv use ten-stable  # same as above


- `remove` removes one or more aliases if defined. It is required to specify the
alias (or aliases) to remove.

   $ pgenv alias remove ten-stable
   $ pgenv alias remove foo bar
   
   
Please note that it is not possible to remove all aliases: at least one alias
per instance must be available for `pgenv` to use each instance.

### pgenv current

Displays the currently active PostgreSQL version.

    $ pgenv current
    10.4

Please note that `version` is a command synonym for version:

    $ pgenv version
    10.4

### pgenv clear

Clears the currently active version of PostgreSQL. If the current version is
running, `clear` will stop it before clearing it.

    $ pgenv clear
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    PostgreSQL stopped
    PostgreSQL cleared

### pgenv build

Downloads and builds the specified version of PostgreSQL and its contrib
modules, as far back as 8.0. 
It is possible to instrument the build process to patch the source tree, see
the section on patching later on.
If the version is already built, it will not be rebuilt; use
`clear` to remove an existing version before building it again.

    $ pgenv build 10.3
    # [Curl, configure, and make output elided]
    PostgreSQL 10.3 built

The build phase can be customized via a configuration file, in the case
the system does not find a configuration file when the `build` is executed,
a warning is shown to the user to remind she can edit a configuration file
and start over the build process:

```sh
$ pgenv build 10.3
  ...
WARNING: no configuration file found for version 10.3
HINT: if you wish to customize the build process please
stop the execution within 5 seconds (CTRL-c) and run
    pgenv config write 10.3 && pgenv config edit 10.3
adjust 'configure' and 'make' options and flags and run again
    pgenv build 10.3
```

Within the configuration file it is possible to instrument
the build phase from the configuration to the actual build. For instance,
in order to build with PL/Perl, it is possible to configure
the variable `PGENV_CONFIGURE_OPTS` adding `--with-perl`. Please note that
it is possible to pass argument variables within the command line to
instrument the build phase. As an example, the following is a possible
work-flow to configure and build a customized 10.5 instance:


    $ pgenv config write 10.5
    $ pgenv config edit 10.5
    # adjust PGENV_CONFIGURE_OPTS
    $ pgenv build 10.5

In the case you need to specify a particular variable, such as the Perl interpreter,
pass it on the command line at the time of build:

   $ PERL=/usr/local/my-fancy-perl pgenv build 10.5
   
#### Patching

`pgenv` can patch the source tree before the build process starts.
In particular, the `patch/` folder can contain a set of index files
and patch to apply. The process searches for an index file corresponding
to the PostgreSQL version to build, and if found applies all the patches
contained into the index.

Index files are named after the PostgreSQL version and the Operating System;
in particular the name of an index file is composed as `patch.<version>.<os>`
where `version` is the PostgreSQL version number (or a part of it) and
`os` is the Operating System. As an example, `patch.8.1.4.Linux` represents
the index used when building PostgreSQL 8.1.4 on a Linux machine.
To provide more flexibility, the system searches for an index that is named
after the exact PostgreSQL version and Operating System or a mix of
possible combinations of those.
As an example, in the case of the PostgreSQL version
8.1.4 the index files is searched among one of the following:

      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8.1.4.Linux
      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8.1.4
      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8.1.Linux
      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8.1
      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8.Linux
      $PGENV_ROOT/patch/index/patch.8


This allows you to specify an index for pretty much any combination or grouping desired.
The first index file that matches wins and it is the only one used for the build process. 
If no index file is found at all, no patching is applied on the source tree.

The index file must contain a list of patches to apply, that is file names (either absolute
or relative to the `patch/` subfolder). Each individual file is applied thru `patch(1)`.

It is possible to specify a particular index file, that means avoid the automatic index selection,
by either setting the `PGENV_PATCH_INDEX` variable on the command line or in the configuration
file. As an example

    $ PGENV_PATCH_INDEX=/src/my-patch-list.txt pgenv build 10.5



### pgenv remove

Removes the specified version of PostgreSQL unless it is the currently-active
version. Use the `clear` command to clear the active version before removing it.

    $ pgenv remove 10.3
    PostgreSQL 10.3 removed

The command removes the version, data directory, source code and configuration, 
as well as all the aliases pointing to such version (if any).

The command accepts an alias, if defined, to indicate the PostgreSQL installation
to remove.

### pgenv start

Starts the currently active version of PostgreSQL if it's not already running.
Initializes the data directory if none exists.

    $ pgenv start
    PostgreSQL started
    
It is possible to specify flags to pass to `pg_ctl(1)` when performing the
`START` action, setting the `PGENV_START_OPTS` in the [configuration](#pgenv-config).
Such options must not include the data directory, nor the log file.

### pgenv stop

Stops the currently active version of PostgreSQL.

    $ pgenv stop
    PostgreSQL 10.5 stopped

It is possible to specify flags to pass to `pg_ctl(1)` when performing the
`stop` action, setting the `PGENV_STOP_OPTS` in the [configuration](#pgenv-config).

### pgenv restart

Restarts the currently active version of PostgreSQL, or starts it if it's not
already running.

    $ pgenv restart
    PostgreSQL 10.1 restarted
    Logging to pgsql/data/server.log

It is possible to specify flags to pass to `pg_ctl(1)` when performing the
`restart` action, setting the `PGENV_RESTART_OPTS` in the [configuration](#pgenv-config).


### pgenv available

Shows all the versions of PostgreSQL available to download and build. Handy to
help you finding a version to pass to the `build` command. Note that the `available`
command produces copious output.

    $ pgenv available
    ...
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

                        PostgreSQL 11
        ------------------------------------------------
        11beta1  11beta2  11beta3

The versions are organized and sorted by major release number. Any listed
version may be passed to the `build` command.

To limit the list to versions for specific major releases, pass them to
`available`. For example, to list only the `9.6` and `10` available versions:

    $ pgenv available 10 9.6
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

### pgenv check

Checks the list of commands required to download and build PostgreSQL. Prints
a result for each, with either the path to the command or an error reporting
that the command was not found.

### pgenv help

Outputs a brief usage statement and summary of available commands, like
the following:

    $ pgenv help
    Usage: pgenv <command> [<args>]
    The pgenv commands are:
        use        Set and start the current PostgreSQL version
        clear      Stop and unset the current PostgreSQL version
        start      Start the current PostgreSQL server
        stop       Stop the current PostgreSQL server
        restart    Restart the current PostgreSQL server
        build      Build a specific version of PostgreSQL
        remove     Remove a specific version of PostgreSQL
        version    Show the current PostgreSQL version
        current    Same as 'version'
        versions   List all PostgreSQL versions available to pgenv
        help       Show this usage statement and command summary
        available  Show which versions can be downloaded
        check      Check all program dependencies
        config     View, edit, delete the program configuration
        alias      Add, remove alias for installed PostgreSQL versions

    For full documentation, see: https://github.com/theory/pgenv#readme

### pgenv config

View, set, and delete configuration variables, both globally or for specific
versions of PostgreSQL. Stores the configuration in Bash files, one for each
version, as well as a default configuration. If pgenv cannot find a
configuration variable in a version-specific configuration file, it will look
in the default configuration. If it doesn't find it there, it tires to guess
the appropriate values, or falls back on its own defaults.

The `config` command accepts the following subcommands:

- `show` prints the current or specified version configuration
- `write` store the current or specified version configuration
- `edit` opens the current or specified version configuration in an editor (Using $EDITOR, e.g: export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim)
- `delete` removes the specified configuration

Each sub-command accepts a PostgreSQL version number (e.g., `10.5`) or a
special keyword:

- `current` or `version` tells pgenv to use the currently active version of
  PostgreSQL
- `default` tells pgenv to use the default configuration.

If no version is explicitly passed to any of the `config` subcommands, the
program will work against the currently active version of PostgreSQL.

In order to start with a default configuration, use the `write` subcommand:

    $ pgenv config write default
    pgenv configuration file ~/.pgenv/.pgenv.conf written

A subsequent `show` displays the defaults:

``` sh
$ pgenv config show default
# Default configuration
# pgenv configuration for PostgreSQL
# File: /home/luca/git/misc/PostgreSQL/pgenv/.pgenv.conf
# ---------------------------------------------------
# pgenv configuration created on mer 12 set 2018, 08.35.52, CEST

# Enables debug output
# PGENV_DEBUG=''

###### Build settings #####
# Make command to use for build
# PGENV_MAKE=''

# Make flags
PGENV_MAKE_OPTS='-j3'

# Configure flags
# PGENV_CONFIGURE_OPTS=''


# ...

##### Runtime options #####
# Path to the cluster log file
PGENV_LOG='/home/luca/git/misc/PostgreSQL/pgenv/pgsql/data/server.log'

# Cluster administrator user
PGENV_PG_USER='postgres'

# Initdb flags
PGENV_INITDB_OPTS='-U postgres --locale en_US.UTF-8 --encoding UNICODE'

# ...
```

You can edit the file and adjust parameters to your needs.

In order to create a configuration file for a specific version, pass the
version to the `write` subcommand:

   $ pgenv config write 10.5
   pgenv configuration file [~/.pgenv/.pgenv.10.5.conf] written

Each time pgenv writes a configuration file, it first creates a backup with
the suffix `.backup`.

Use the `edit` subcommand to edit a configuration file in your favourite
editor:

   $ pgenv config edit 10.5
   <output omitted>

The `edit` command will start your favourite editor, that is whatever
it is set within the `EDITOR` variable. If such variable is not set
you will be warned.
Use the `delete` subcommand to delete a configuration:

   $ pgenv config delete 10.5
   Configuration file ~/.pgenv/.pgenv.10.5.conf (and backup) deleted

Note that you cannot delete the default configuration unless all other
versions have been removed (e.g., by `pgenv remove`). This prevents accidental
loss of configuration:

   $ pgenv config delete
   Cannot delete default configuration while version configurations exist
   To remove it anyway, delete ~/.pgenv/.pgenv.conf.

The `delete` subcommand deletes both the configuration file and its backup
copy. The `pgenv remove` command also deletes any configuration for the
removed version.
